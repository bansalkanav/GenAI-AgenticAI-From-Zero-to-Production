    "## **Introduction to Chat Models**\n",
    "\n",
    "LangChain provides a unified interface for interacting with various chat models from different providers (OpenAI, Google, Anthropic, Cohere, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "LangChain chat models are named with a convention that prefixes \"Chat\" to their class names (e.g., ChatOllama, ChatAnthropic, ChatOpenAI, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### **What are Chat Models?**\n",
    "At their core, chat models are a specialized type of Large Language Model (LLM) designed and fine-tuned to engage in conversational interactions. Unlike older \"text completion\" models (which simply predict the next word given a string of text), chat models understand and operate on a concept of \"messages\" with associated \"roles.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Modern LLMs are typically accessed through a chat model interface that takes a list of messages as input and returns an AI message as output. Chat Models are customized for conversational usage. **[Click Here](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/chat/)** to check the complete list of LLMs which can be used with LangChain.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Chat Models Input: A list of BaseMessage objects (typically SystemMessage, HumanMessage, AIMessage)**\n",
    "```\n",
    "[SystemMessage(content=\"You are a helpful assistant.\"), HumanMessage(content=\"What is the capital of France?\")]\n",
    "```\n",
    "**Chat Models Output: A single AIMessage object**\n",
    "```\n",
    "AIMessage(content=\"The capital of France is Paris.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Capabilities**\n",
    "\n",
    "The newest generation of chat models offer additional capabilities:\n",
    "1. [Tool calling](https://python.langchain.com/docs/concepts/tool_calling/): Many popular chat models offer a native tool calling API. This API allows developers to build rich applications that enable LLMs to interact with external services, APIs, and databases. Tool calling can also be used to extract structured information from unstructured data and perform various other tasks.\n",
    "2. [Structured output](https://python.langchain.com/docs/concepts/structured_outputs/): A technique to make a chat model respond in a structured format, such as JSON that matches a given schema.\n",
    "3. [Multimodality](https://python.langchain.com/docs/concepts/multimodality/): The ability to work with data other than text; for example, images, audio, and video.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Integrations**\n",
    "LangChain has many chat model integrations that allow you to use a wide variety of models from different providers. These integrations are one of two types:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Official models:** These are models that are officially supported by LangChain and/or model provider. You can find these models in the **`langchain-<provider>`** packages.\n",
    "2. **Community models:** There are models that are mostly contributed and supported by the community. You can find these models in the **`langchain-community`** package."

    "1. **Transformers Library:** A powerful Python library that makes it easy to download, train, and use pre-trained NLP models (including chat models).\n",

    "Many LLMs, including those capable of chat, are available on the HuggingFace Hub. These can range from smaller, open-source models that you can run locally to larger models that might require more significant computational resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Why use HuggingFace Chat Models with LangChain?**\n",
    "\n",
    "While cloud-based LLMs like OpenAI's GPT models or Google's Gemini are powerful, HuggingFace offers distinct advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Open Source & Flexibility:** Many models on HuggingFace are open-source, giving you more control, transparency, and the ability to fine-tune them for very specific tasks.\n",
    "2. **Cost-Effectiveness (Potentially):** If you can run models locally or on your own infrastructure, you can potentially reduce API costs associated with commercial LLM providers.\n",
    "3. **Privacy/Security:** For sensitive data, running models locally or on your private cloud can offer better privacy and security controls.\n",
    "4. **Experimentation:** A vast playground for trying out different model architectures and sizes.\n",
    "5. **Community Support:** A very active and helpful community.\n",
    "\n",
    "LangChain acts as a crucial bridge here. It provides a consistent interface (`ChatHuggingFace` class) that allows you to easily integrate models from the HuggingFace ecosystem into your LangChain applications, abstracting away much of the underlying complexity of the transformers library.\n",
    "\n",

    "## **LangChain New Unified Chat Model API**\n",
    "\n",
    "LangChain’s standard model interfaces give you access to many different provider integrations, which makes it easy to experiment with and switch between models to find the best fit for your use case.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Basic usage**\n",
    "Models can be utilized in two ways:\n",
    "1. Standalone - Models can be called directly for tasks like text generation, classification, or extraction without the need for an agent framework.\n",
    "2. With agents - Models can be dynamically specified when creating an agent.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Initialize a model**\n",
    "The easiest way to get started with a standalone model in LangChain is to use init_chat_model to initialize one from a chat model provider of your choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Syntax:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from langchain.chat_models import init_chat_model\n",
    "\n",
    "model = init_chat_model(\"gpt-4o-mini\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Parameters**\n",
    "\n",
    "A chat model takes parameters that can be used to configure its behavior. The full set of supported parameters varies by model and provider, but standard ones include:\n",
    "1. **model** - The name or identifier of the specific model you want to use with a provider. You can also specify both the model and its provider in a single argument using the '{model_provider}:{model}' format, for example, ‘openai:o1’. Will attempt to infer model_provider from model if not specified. The following providers will be inferred based on these model prefixes:\n",
    "    - gpt-... | o1... | o3... -> openai\n",
    "    - claude... -> anthropic\n",
    "    - amazon... -> bedrock\n",
    "    - gemini... -> google_vertexai\n",
    "    - command... -> cohere\n",
    "    - accounts/fireworks... -> fireworks\n",
    "    - mistral... -> mistralai\n",
    "    - deepseek... -> deepseek\n",
    "    - grok... -> xai\n",
    "    - sonar... -> perplexity\n",
    "2. **model_provider** - The model provider if not specified as part of the model arg (see above). Supported model_provider values and the corresponding integration package are:\n",
    "    - openai -> langchain-openai\n",
    "    - anthropic -> langchain-anthropic\n",
    "    - azure_openai -> langchain-openai\n",
    "    - azure_ai -> langchain-azure-ai\n",
    "    - google_vertexai -> langchain-google-vertexai\n",
    "    - google_genai -> langchain-google-genai\n",
    "    - bedrock -> langchain-aws\n",
    "    - bedrock_converse -> langchain-aws\n",
    "    - cohere -> langchain-cohere\n",
    "    - fireworks -> langchain-fireworks\n",
    "    - together -> langchain-together\n",
    "    - mistralai -> langchain-mistralai\n",
    "    - huggingface -> langchain-huggingface\n",
    "    - groq -> langchain-groq\n",
    "    - ollama -> langchain-ollama\n",
    "    - google_anthropic_vertex -> langchain-google-vertexai\n",
    "    - deepseek -> langchain-deepseek\n",
    "    - ibm -> langchain-ibm\n",
    "    - nvidia -> langchain-nvidia-ai-endpoints\n",
    "    - xai -> langchain-xai\n",
    "    - perplexity -> langchain-perplexity\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **api_key** - The key required for authenticating with the model’s provider. This is usually issued when you sign up for access to the model.\n",
    "4.  ****kwargs** - Additional model-specific keyword args to pass to the underlying chat model's __init__ method. Common parameters include:\n",
    "    - temperature: Model temperature for controlling randomness.\n",
    "    - max_tokens: Maximum number of output tokens.\n",
    "    - timeout: Maximum time (in seconds) to wait for a response.\n",
    "    - max_retries: Maximum number of retry attempts for failed requests.\n",
    "    - base_url: Custom API endpoint URL.\n",
    "    - rate_limiter: A BaseRateLimiter instance to control request rate.\n",
