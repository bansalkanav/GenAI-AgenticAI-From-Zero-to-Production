    "## **Why Chunking Matters?**\n",
    "Notice that after you load a Documnet object from a source, you end up with strings by grabbing them from page_content. In certain situations, the length of the strings may be too large to feed into a model, both embedding and chat model.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note: LLMs have fixed maximum context window. If you document contains more token then the maximum context window size, LLMs won't be able to process it. So, it is important to break the documents into chunks.**\n",
    "\n",
    "In short:\n",
    "- Good chunks → high retrieval accuracy\n",
    "- Bad chunks → LLM hallucinations + incomplete answers\n",
    "- Chunking is 50% of RAG performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **What is Chunking?**\n",
    "Once you've loaded documents, you'll often want to transform them to better suit your application. The simplest example is you may want to split a long document into smaller chunks that can fit into your model's context window. LangChain has a number of built-in document transformers that make it easy to split, combine, filter, and otherwise manipulate documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you want to deal with long pieces of text, it is necessary to split up that text into chunks. As simple as this sounds, there is a lot of potential complexity here. Ideally, you want to keep the semantically related pieces of text together. What \"semantically related\" means could depend on the type of text. This notebook showcases several ways to do that.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note: Think of it like organizing a massive book into chapters and sections. When someone asks a question, you only retrieve the relevant chapters, not the entire book, making retrieval faster and more accurate.**\n",
    "\n",
    "A good chunk has:\n",
    "- one clear idea/theme (not 5 unrelated things)\n",
    "- long enough to contain useful info\n",
    "- not too long for embedding models\n",
    "- fits the retrieval goal (FAQs vs Legal Docs vs Code need different chunk sizes)\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Visualize Chunking**  \n",
    "You can evaluate text splitters with the [Chunkviz utility](https://www.chunkviz.com/) created by Greg Kamradt. Chunkviz is a great tool for visualizing how your text splitter is working. It will show you how your text is being split up and help in tuning up the splitting parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **How Chunking Works?**\n",
    "1. Split the text up into small, semantically meaningful chunks (often sentences).\n",
    "2. Start combining these small chunks into a larger chunk until you reach a certain size (as measured by some function).\n",
    "3. Once you reach that size, make that chunk its own piece of text and then start creating a new chunk of text with some overlap (to keep context between chunks).\n",
    "\n",
    "That means there are two different axes along which you can customize your text splitter:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. How the text is split\n",
    "2. How the chunk size is measured\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Choosing Chunk Size**\n",
    "- **Small chunks (250-500 tokens):** Better for specific factual questions, reduces noise in retrieval\n",
    "- **Medium chunks (500-1000 tokens):** Balanced approach, good for general Q&A\n",
    "- **Large chunks (1000+ tokens):** Preserves more context, better for complex reasoning but retrieves more text\n",
    "\n",
    "Pro tip: Start with **chunk_size=1000**, **chunk_overlap=200** and adjust if retrieval quality is poor.\n",
    "\n",
    "- chunk_size=1000: Target chunk size in characters. Adjust based on your model's context window\n",
    "- chunk_overlap=200: Characters to overlap between consecutive chunks. Prevents context loss at chunk boundaries\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Types of Text Splitters**\n",
    "LangChain offers many different types of text splitters. These all live in the `langchain-text-splitters` package. Below is a table listing all of them, along with a few characteristics:\n",
    "> **Name:** Name of the text splitter  \n",
    "> **Splits On:** How this text splitter splits text  \n",
    "> **Adds Metadata:** Whether or not this text splitter adds metadata about where each chunk came from.  \n",

The default list is `[\"\\n\\n\", \"\\n\", \" \", \"\"]`. This has the effect of trying to keep all paragraphs (and then sentences, and then words) together as long as possible, as those would generically seem to be the strongest semantically related pieces of text.\n",
