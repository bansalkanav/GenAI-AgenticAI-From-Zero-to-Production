    "# **Persistence**\n",
    "\n",
    "To make it work across multiple \"Turns,\" we need one extra ingredient we haven't used yet: Persistence (Memory).\n",
    "\n",
    "LangGraph has a built-in persistence layer, implemented through checkpointers. When you compile a graph with a checkpointer, the checkpointer saves a checkpoint of the graph state at every super-step.\n",
    "\n",
    "Those checkpoints are saved to a thread, which can be accessed after graph execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use MemorySaver to simulate a database that remembers the state between user interactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "When invoking a graph with a checkpointer, you must specify a thread_id as part of the configurable portion of the config:\n",
    "```json\n",
    "{\"configurable\": {\"thread_id\": \"1\"}}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The checkpointer uses thread_id as the primary key for storing and retrieving checkpoints. Without it, the checkpointer cannot save state or resume execution after an interrupt, since the checkpointer uses thread_id to load the saved state."
